This afternoon I have been giving a short introduction to reactive applications and basic Akka concepts at the Madrid Scala Meetup.

Below you can find the slides I've used during my presentation.

I have enjoyed a lot being there, and, hopefully I can attend more often to the future talks. Any kind of feedback about the talk: short/long content, bad/very bad explained, ... would be really really 	appreciated
