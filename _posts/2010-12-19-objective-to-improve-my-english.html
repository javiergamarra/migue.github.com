I need to improve my written English (okay, the spoken as well :) ) so i have decided to change the language of blog posts for a while. I am not clear how long i will be able to do this but i am going to try it. All kind of corrections are (and will be) welcome.<br /><br />It's true that i should increase my post's frequency in order to achieve it :)<br /><br />Next blog post: OSGI in the enterprise.<br /><br />Cheers!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/35092134-3532946475890732798?l=miguelinlas3.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
